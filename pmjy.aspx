             In a run up to the formal launch of this scheme, the Prime Minister personally mailed to Chairmans of all PSU banks to gear up for the gigantic task of enrolling over 7.5 crore (75 million) households and to open their accounts. In this email he categorically declared that a bank account for each household was a "national priority".[citation needed]

The scheme has been started with a target to provide 'universal and clear access to banking facilities' starting with "Basic Banking Accounts" with overdraft facility of ₹5,000 (US$74) after six months and RuPay Debit card with inbuilt accident insurance cover of ₹1 lakh (US$1,500) and RuPay Kisan Card. In next phase, micro insurance & pension etc. will also be added.

Under the scheme.It was reported that total of 7 Crore (70 million) bank accounts have been opened with deposits totaling more than ₹50 billion (US$740 million) as of 6 November 2014. As the government met the target, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has revised the target for opening of bank accounts under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), the ambitious financial inclusion scheme launched by the government, from 7.5 crore to 10 crore by 26 January 2015. On 20 January 2015, the scheme entered into Guinness book of world records setting new record for 'The most bank accounts opened in one week'.
                The number of accounts opened under the scheme reached 219 million (including 57 million zero balance accounts) by 18 May 2016. The amount of deposits rose to ₹380.47 billion (US$5.7 billion) by April 2016.[13] 19 lakh householders have availed the overdraft facility of ₹2.56 billion (US$38 million) by May 2016. As per the 26.11.2016 status total account deposits balance is Rs.64250/-
