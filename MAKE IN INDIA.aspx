             Make in India is an initiative launched by the Government of India to encourage multi-national, as well as national companies to manufacture their products in India. It was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 25 September 2014. India emerged, after initiation of the programme in 2015 as the top destination globally for foreign direct investment (FDI), surpassing the United States of America as well as the People's Republic of China. In 2015, India received US$63 billion in FDI.

With the demand for electronic hardware expected to rise rapidly to US$400 billion by 2020, India has the potential to become an electronic manufacturing hub. The government is targeting to achieve net zero imports of electronics by 2020 by creating a level playing field and providing an enabling environment.
